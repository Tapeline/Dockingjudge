## Deployment
(you may want to replace the domain name in files with you own)

```sh
docker build -t dockingjudge-unit JudgeUnit
docker compose up -d rabbitmq    # for some reason rabbitmq sometimes does not start properly. I am investigating this issue
docker compose up -d --build
```

also replace example sensitive information in .env (like SECRET_KEY)


### Dev env
If you want to deploy locally, without a domain, then you
need to deploy frontend separately:
1. ```sh
   $ cd Frontend
   $ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   $ npm run dev -- --host --port 3000
   ```
2. ```nginx configuration
   # api_gateway_nginx.conf
   
   # proxy_pass http://frontend.service:3000;
   proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000;
   ```

## Structure

Dockingjudge consists of several services:
